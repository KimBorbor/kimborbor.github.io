            <h2>What is a Sneakerhead?</h2>
            <p> A sneakerhead is someone who is passionate about collecting, trading, and wearing sneakers, often as a hobby. Sneakerheads typically seek out limited-edition or rare sneakers, follow sneaker trends, and might even resell certain pairs for profit. They usually have a deep knowledge of sneaker brands, history, and the culture surrounding them, especially in relation to sports, streetwear, and fashion.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p> The history of sneakerhead culture can be traced back to the late 1970s and 1980s, with basketball and hip-hop playing major roles in its development. It began with the rise of athletes endorsing sneakers, most notably when Nike signed Michael Jordan in 1985 to create the iconic Air Jordan 1. This sneaker not only revolutionized the industry but also turned shoes into coveted items beyond sports, becoming symbols of style and status. At the same time, hip-hop culture in New York City embraced sneakers as a core part of street fashion, with artists like Run-D.M.C. famously endorsing Adidas in their music. These two movements—basketball and hip-hop—combined to create a foundation for sneaker culture, turning limited-edition releases and exclusive drops into highly sought-after items, leading to the growth of sneakerheads who collect and trade sneakers as both fashion statements and investments.
